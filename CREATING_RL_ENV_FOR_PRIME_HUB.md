# Creating a Reinforcement Learning Environment for Prime Intellect Hub

## The Idea

The goal was to build a custom reinforcement learning environment that could be shared on Prime Intellect's Environment Hub. The environment simulates ship navigation through dynamic ocean conditions where an agent must find optimal routes while minimizing costs based on environmental factors like wave height, current velocity, temperature, and water depth.

This isn't just an academic exercise. Real-world maritime routing faces these exact challenges. Ships need to balance fuel efficiency, time, and safety while navigating through constantly changing ocean conditions. By framing this as an RL problem, we can explore how different algorithms learn to make these tradeoffs.

## Core Concept

The environment is a 2D grid where each cell represents a section of ocean with four environmental parameters. The agent (ship) observes a local 3x3 patch around its current position and must choose which direction to move. The reward signal is the negative cost of entering a cell, so the agent learns to avoid high-cost areas like rough seas or shallow water.

What makes this interesting is that it's not just about finding the shortest path. The optimal route depends on the cost function weights, which can be adjusted to prioritize different factors. A cargo ship might weight fuel efficiency heavily, while a rescue vessel might prioritize speed over cost.

## Building the Environment

### Step 1: Define the Core Environment Class

The environment follows the Gymnasium API, which is the standard interface for RL environments. This means implementing a few key methods:

- `reset()`: Initialize the environment and return the starting observation
- `step(action)`: Execute an action, update state, return observation, reward, and done flags
- `render()`: Optional visualization

The observation space is a dictionary containing:
- A local 3x3 grid of cost values around the agent
- The agent's current position
- The goal position

The action space is discrete with 9 actions: stay in place or move in one of 8 directions (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW).

### Step 2: Cost Function Design

The cost function aggregates multiple environmental channels into a single cost value per cell. Each channel (wave height, current velocity, temperature, depth) gets normalized to 0-1 range, then weighted and summed.

The key insight here is that different applications need different cost functions. We made it configurable so users can adjust weights based on their use case. You can also apply transformations to individual channels before aggregation, like smoothing or non-linear scaling.

### Step 3: Data Generation and Loading

Real ocean data comes from sources like NOAA or Copernicus Marine Service, typically in netCDF format. We built utilities to:
- Load and convert netCDF files to our internal format
- Generate synthetic grids for testing and development
- Save/load preprocessed grids efficiently

The synthetic data generator creates spatially correlated patterns that mimic real ocean conditions. Wave heights increase near boundaries, temperature gradients run north to south, depth increases toward the center. This gives the environment realistic structure without requiring actual oceanographic data.

### Step 4: Baseline Agents

To validate the environment, we implemented three baseline agents:

1. Random agent: Takes random actions, establishes a lower bound on performance
2. Greedy agent: Moves toward the goal while considering local costs
3. A* pathfinding: Computes the optimal path given perfect information

These baselines serve multiple purposes. They verify the environment works correctly, provide performance benchmarks, and help debug reward shaping issues. If your RL agent can't beat the greedy baseline, something is probably wrong with your setup.

### Step 5: Packaging for Prime Hub

This is where things get specific to Prime Intellect's requirements. The Hub expects a particular structure:

```
your-repo/
├── pyproject.toml              # Main package metadata
├── your_package/               # Your Python package
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── envs/                   # Environment implementations
│   ├── utils/                  # Helper functions
│   └── data/                   # Sample data
└── environments/
    └── your-env-name/          # Hub template folder
        ├── pyproject.toml      # Template metadata
        ├── README.md           # Hub documentation
        └── load_environment.py # Entry point
```

The critical piece is `load_environment.py`. This file must export a function that returns an environment factory. The Hub calls this function to create environment instances for evaluation.

### Step 6: Making It Work

The packaging process had several gotchas:

**TOML syntax**: Python's tomllib is strict about TOML format. Arrays must use brackets, not JSON-style syntax. Dependencies must be properly quoted strings.

**Import paths**: The loader needs to import from your installed package, not relative paths. This means your main package must be pip-installable and actually installed (even in editable mode) before the template will work.

**Data paths**: The loader needs to find data files. We used absolute paths computed relative to the loader's location to avoid issues with working directory.

**Gymnasium version**: Prime Hub uses Gymnasium 0.28.1 specifically. Using a different version can cause subtle API incompatibilities.

### Step 7: Testing and Validation

Before pushing to the Hub, we verified:

1. Package installs cleanly with `pip install -e .`
2. Main package imports without errors
3. Environment can be instantiated and reset
4. Actions execute and return valid observations
5. Episodes terminate correctly
6. The loader function works from the template directory

Each of these seems obvious but catches real issues. For example, we initially had the observation space wrong, which only showed up when actually stepping through an episode.

## Design Decisions and Tradeoffs

**Dict vs Box observation space**: We chose a Dict space to separate the local grid, agent position, and goal position. This makes it easier for agents to extract relevant information. The downside is slightly more complex observation handling.

**Discrete vs Continuous actions**: We went with discrete actions (9 directions) rather than continuous control. This simplifies the problem and makes it easier to compare different algorithms. Real ship navigation is more continuous, but discrete actions are a reasonable approximation for grid-based routing.

**Cost map vs dynamic simulation**: The environment uses a static cost map rather than simulating ocean dynamics. This trades realism for computational efficiency and reproducibility. Real oceans change over time, but for learning routing strategies, a static map is sufficient.

**Normalization strategy**: We normalize each channel independently using percentile clipping. This handles outliers gracefully and ensures all channels contribute meaningfully to the final cost. The alternative would be domain-specific normalization, but that requires more oceanographic knowledge.

## What Makes This Environment Useful

The environment is simple enough to train quickly but complex enough to be interesting. The multi-channel cost function creates non-obvious optimal paths. The local observation forces agents to learn navigation strategies rather than memorizing routes.

It's also extensible. You can add more environmental channels, change the cost function, adjust the observation window size, or modify the action space. The modular design makes these changes straightforward.

For research, it provides a testbed for:
- Multi-objective optimization (balancing different cost factors)
- Partial observability (local vs global information)
- Transfer learning (training on one ocean, testing on another)
- Safe exploration (avoiding high-cost regions)

## Lessons Learned

**Start with the simplest version that works**: We initially tried to include time-varying conditions and multiple ships. Stripping back to a single agent on a static grid made development much faster.

**Test incrementally**: Don't write the entire environment then try to run it. Build and test each component separately. This caught issues early when they were easy to fix.

**Follow the standard**: Using Gymnasium's API exactly as specified saved countless hours. Every deviation requires custom handling downstream.

**Documentation matters**: The README in the Hub template is what users see first. Clear examples and explicit observation/action space descriptions prevent confusion.

**Packaging is not optional**: Even if your code works locally, it needs proper packaging to be shareable. Invest time in getting pyproject.toml right.

## Using the Environment

Once published on Prime Hub, users can load the environment with:

```python
from load_environment import load_environment

env_factory = load_environment()
env = env_factory()

obs, info = env.reset()
for step in range(100):
    action = env.action_space.sample()
    obs, reward, done, truncated, info = env.step(action)
    if done:
        break
```

They can customize it by passing parameters to `load_environment()`:

```python
env_factory = load_environment(
    grid_path="path/to/custom_grid.npz",
    weights=[1.0, 0.8, 0.3, 0.5],
    patch_size=5,
    max_steps=1000
)
```

This flexibility lets researchers adapt the environment to their specific needs without modifying the core code.

## Future Directions

The current version is functional but could be extended in several ways:

**Dynamic conditions**: Add time-varying environmental parameters that change during an episode. This would require agents to adapt to changing conditions.

**Multi-agent scenarios**: Multiple ships navigating the same ocean, potentially competing for routes or coordinating to avoid collisions.

**Partial observability**: Limit what the agent can observe, perhaps requiring it to build a mental map of the environment.

**Realistic physics**: Incorporate actual ship dynamics like momentum, turning radius, and fuel consumption models.

**Real data integration**: Build pipelines to automatically fetch and process real oceanographic data from public sources.

But the current version serves its purpose: a clean, well-documented environment that others can use and build upon. Sometimes that's enough.

## Conclusion

Creating an RL environment for Prime Hub involves more than just writing the environment logic. You need to think about the problem formulation, design a clean API, handle data properly, implement baselines, and package everything correctly.

The process is iterative. You'll discover issues when testing, realize your observation space isn't quite right, or find that your reward function doesn't incentivize the behavior you want. That's normal. The key is to build incrementally, test thoroughly, and document clearly.

The result is a reusable research tool that others can experiment with, extend, and learn from. That's the point of sharing environments on a hub rather than keeping them in private repositories. Good environments accelerate research by giving everyone a common starting point.
